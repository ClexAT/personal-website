  Humans strive to explore the solar system more than ever before. Many
  companies are racing towards

  providing launch services that are finally becoming feasible for interplanetary travel. Entry, descent, and

  landing from orbital and interplanetary trajectories is another important element that has to be further

  investigated. It also seems to get less attention than launch services. In recent history, the development

  of supersonic parachutes has experienced some setbacks, as it is a challenging technology.

  This is why we decided to take a look at the alternatives in this field. Reusability and the avoidance

  of active propulsion are key goals a possible alternative technology has to fulfil. In addition to gliders,

  which are already under investigation, we found autorotation. Commonly used for emergency landings by

  helicopters, the last time it was seriously investigated for space applications was in the 1960s by NASA.

  One of the key features is that there is no drogue chute needed, the system can perform both supersonic

  and subsonic deceleration. Space-grade parachutes are also single-use components and are not considered

  reusable, whereas rotor-based reentry systems show much more potential to be reusable. Another key

  advantage is steerability. Parachutes are hard to steer, however, rotor steerability by means of a swash

  disk is an already well-established solution. A rotor-based landing system can also land with virtually

  zero velocity, significantly softening the landing compared to parachutes.

  All these clear and outstanding advantages motivated us to investigate this concept. In 2016, our

  team was formed by more than 25 students from 4 universities, in 2 countries. The remote collaboration

  and sharing of workpackages was a challenge, but also our key to success for building the vehicle named

  SpaceSeed in just 2 years.

  The first flight from a height of 80km, proved that the rotor can withstand a Mach 2 reentry and

  significantly slow the craft down. Flight results show that there is potential for this technology, and so

  the team decided to build an improved version, set to fly on REXUS 29 in March 2021. The key change

  compared to Version 1 is the controllability of the collective pitch, which will allow a softer landing

  and inflight rotor speed control. A bigger sensor package including RADAR needs to be carried and

  implemented to support the flight controller. This additional objective is key for the next steps of proving

  that autorotation is capable of outperforming parachutes in entry, descent and landing
