abstract: "Ceres, as revealed by NASA's Dawn spacecraft, is an ancient,
  crater-saturated body dominated by low-albedo clays. Yet, localised sites
  display a bright, carbonate mineralogy that may be as young as 2 Myr. The
  largest of these bright regions (faculae) are found in the 92 km Occator
  Crater, and would have formed by the eruption of alkaline brines from a
  subsurface reservoir of fluids. The internal structure and surface chemistry
  suggest that Ceres is an extant host for a number of the known prerequisites
  for terrestrial biota, and as such, represents an accessible insight into a
  potentially habitable “ocean world”. In this paper, the case and the means for
  a return mission to Ceres are outlined, presenting the Calathus mission to
  return to Earth a sample of the Occator Crater faculae for high-precision
  laboratory analyses. Calathus consists of an orbiter and a lander with an
  ascent module: the orbiter is equipped with a high-resolution camera, a
  thermal imager, and a radar; the lander contains a sampling arm, a camera, and
  an on-board gas chromatograph mass spectrometer; and the ascent module
  contains vessels for four cerean samples, collectively amounting to a maximum
  40 g. Upon return to Earth, the samples would be characterised via
  high-precision analyses to understand the salt and organic composition of the
  Occator faculae, and from there to assess both the habitability and the
  evolution of a relict ocean world from the dawn of the Solar System."
