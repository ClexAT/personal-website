Hi there! I am Clemens, a PhD Student for Interplanetary Exploration at JMU WÃ¼rzburg.
I am glad you are here to learn more about me!     

I work on propulsionless alternatives for parachutes, mainly autorotation.
This technology could allow us to land with the precision of engines without the need for fuel!

This exciting opportunity drives my research and the work I do!
